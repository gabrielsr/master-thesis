\section{Self-Adaptive Systems}

Self-adaptive systems have been accepted as a promising approach to tackle context change. Self-adaptivesses is an approach in which the system
\textit{"evaluates its own behavior and changes behavior when the evaluation indicates that it is not accomplishing what the software is intended to do, or when better functionality or performance is possible."}\cite{laddaga_self_1997}.

Self-adaptive software aims to adjust various artifacts or attributes in response to changes in the self and in the context of a software system\cite{salehie_self-adaptive_2009}.

A key concept in self-adaptive systems is the awareness of the system. It has two aspects\cite{salehie_self-adaptive_2009}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textit{self-awareness} means a system is aware of its own states and behaviors.
   \item \textit{context-awareness} means that the system is aware of its context,
\end{itemize}

Schilit et al.\cite{klein_survey_2008} define \textit{context} as the sufficiently exact characterization of the situations of a system by means of perceivable information that is relevant for the adaptation of the system

Schilit et al.\cite{klein_survey_2008} define \textit{context adaptation} as \say{a systemâ€™s capability of gathering information about the domain it shares an interface with, evaluating this information and changing its observable behavior according to the current situation}.



% laddaga1997: it should relies on software informed about its mission and about its construction and behavior.  This implies that the software has multiple ways of accomplishing its purpose, and has enough knowledge of its construction to make effective changes at runtime.

% Such software should include functionality for evaluating its behavior and performance, and the ability to replan and reconfigure its operations in order to improve its operation.  Self adaptive software should also include a set of components for each major function, along with descriptions of the components, so that components of systems can be selected and scheduled at runtime, in response to the evaluators.

% It also requires the ability to impedance match input/output of sequenced components, and the ability to generate some of this code from specifications. In addition, we seek this new basis of adaptation to be applied at runtime, as opposed to development/design time, or as a maintenance activity.
