Rainbow is a framework for self-adaptation architecture based\cite{garlan_rainbow:_2004}. It keeps an model of the architecture of the system and can be extended with rules to analysis the system behavior at runtime, find adaptation strategies and perform this changes. It separate the functional code (internal mechanisms) from adaptation code (external mechanism) in a schema called external control, influenced by control theory. \cite{garlan_software_2009}
%Different from our proposal Rainbow don't enforce an specific architecture what could be special useful in case of retrofitting a pre-existent systems.
Different from our proposal it isn't goal-oriented an there is no work on how to relate Rainbow components to requirements.

MUSIC project provides a component-based middleware for adaptation that propose to separate the self-adaptation from business logic and delegate adaptation logic to generic middleware. As in our propose it adapts by evaluating in runtime the utility of alternatives, to chose a feasible one (e.g., the one evaluated as with highest utility)\cite{rouvoy_music:_2009}. As Rainbow, MUSIC is not goal-oriented.
% Yet it provide means of supporting seamless configuration of component frameworks based on local, remote components and services.

Salehie et al. \cite{salehie_towards_2012} propose a run-time goal model and its related
action selection. It models adaptable software as a system that exposes sensors and effectors and  proposes a model consisting in Goals, Attributes and Action for selecting actions that will effect the adaptable software at runtime, giving sensed attributes.
So the adaptation mechanism is to choose the best action given the actual attributes.
As this work it uses explicit runtime goals and make them visible and traceable.
Different from it we use a more symmetric approach that can allow for functional
and adaptation management.
%The validation is make on simulated environment.

GÃ¼nalp et al. \cite{gunalp_autonomic_2012} propose a middleware for pervasive software with autonomic capabilities. The approach is service based. It proposes a component written in a custom language and the use of components repository that allows the discovery on new sensors. The system present a support for adaptability by using policies.
% Different from this work it did not present support for collaboration/delegation of goals to another peers. It don't allow for runtime incorporation of adaptation strategies, also.
