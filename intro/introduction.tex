In the last decade we have seen advances in the study of autonomic computing systems as an alternative to handle the crescent complexity of systems. The complexity in systems come with the need to integrate different systems, to execute in heterogeneous platforms, to run in multiple environments and handle multiple operation scenarios. The self-adaptive alternative to tackle complexity consist in packing together with functional code, self-adaptation code capable of handling uncertainty by monitoring the context and adapting at runtime.

% Motivation

% Dependable high dynamic systems
% With increasing popularity of mobile computation and wireless networks we have seen the rise of  interest in new domains of computation that lead to open-systems that should organize itself.
% ubiquous, IoT, assisted living
% It's the case of \textit{mobile clouds} witch opportunistically form networks to harvest the power of mobile heterogeneous devices \cite{viswanathan_uncertainty-aware_2015}. Such systems could be mapped to multi-agent systems (MAS). In multi-agent systems each agent is a computerized unit capable of make independent decisions.

% Problems

Goal oriented requirements engineering approaches have gained special attention as a technique to specify self-adaption systems. Goal modeling represents a shift in relation to Object Oriented approaches as it focus on stakeholder need and states that the system needs to achieve and not in the system structure. \cite{ali_goal-based_2010}

Dalpiaz proposed Runtime Goal-Models, opposed to the traditional (design-time) Goal Models. He argue that the traditional goals models don't have details for reason about the execution of a goal. \cite{dalpiaz_runtime_2013} % TODO other proposes

In the other side, architecture-based or component-based approaches take care of the implementation of runtime modeling of the system, evaluate the model, planning and execution of adaptation strategies at system level by acting on components of the system or by replacing them. \cite{garlan_software_2009}


% TODO open-adaptation, multi-agents

% why get both together?
% Traceability of goals at runtime. With focus on dependability
% Eu quero que o software seja dependable, traceability is a


In relation to runtime support for self-adaptation systems, to the best of our knowledge there is no proposal of middleware that support goal-model at runtime and component-based adaptation.
