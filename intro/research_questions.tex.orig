To develop what would be a good model we did more questions in relation to the fitness of the model for the purpose of decide on system adaptations. First of all, we want to realize a valid deployment of the system:

Previous work in the literature \cite{pessoa_dependable_2015} have partially tackled this research question. However, our major concern here relates to the traceability between goals and tasks, software architectural components and the context of operation.

To develop what would be a good model we address further questions in relation to the fitness of the model for the purpose of deciding on system adaptations. First of all, we want to realize a valid deployment of the system:
