\section{Problem Definition}

% is there any component model suitable to trace goals and component service.



This work propose a middleware for adaptable open-systems.

The identified requirements are:
\begin{itemize}

 \item Adaptable

 The system should keep a model of itself and allow changes at runtime.

 \item Support for Open-System

 The system should have support for discover and leverage new resources

 \item Decentralized

 The system should be deployed in multiple nodes, without a singe point of failure.

 \item Evolvable

 The system could incorporate new functions and adaptiveness capabilities at runtime

 %\item Model at Runtime
 %The system should have access to a model of itself at runtime.
\end{itemize}

Our proposal built on top of multi-agent system concepts, goal-model and component-based adaptable architectures.

This research question is the search for achieve dependability of the system in face of not dependable components. The system should be able to try different available strategies to achieve a goal.
