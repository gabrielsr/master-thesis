\section{Contributions Summary}

\begin{enumerate}

\item improve dynamic systems dependability using a goal approach
\begin{itemize}
  \item improve maintainability by keeping software modules traceable to system goals and encapsulating plans for goals.
  \item improve system availability by means of runtime adaptation in face of changes in execution context.
  %\item guarantee that the approach keep the system integrity by proving it.
\end{itemize}


% \item component-based runtime goal model middleware support for evolvable systems

% \item a model for open-adaptation and opportunistic computing using multi-agent and component-based runtime goal model

\end{enumerate}
