% is there any component model suitable to trace goals and component service.

To allow the system make decisions about its structure based on requirements and context we need a model that can correlate these three concepts: the system structure, the requirements and the execution context.

% What leads us to or research question:

\noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{0.95\textwidth}{%
        \textbf{Research Question 1 (RQ1):} What would be a good model of software system that
        could allow one to reason about the system structure, context and trace the requirements at runtime? In other words, how to represent the system goals, architectural structure, operation context and their relationship?
    }%
}\bigskip


To develop what would be a good model we did more questions in relation to the fitness of the model for the purpose of decide on system adaptations. First of all, we want to realize a valid deployment of the system:

\noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{0.95\textwidth}{%
        \textbf{Research Question 2 (RQ2):} How to, using the model from RQ1, deploy a Self-Adaptive System that is dependable in face of context uncertainty? % verify if systems goals are achievable at runtime in face of deployment (configuration) uncertainty.

    }%
}\bigskip

Beside check the system validity in other to forecast faults we want to be able to tolerate faults. What leads to the next question:

\setlength{\fboxsep}{10pt}
\noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{0.95\textwidth}{%
        \textbf{Research Question 3 (RQ3):} How to guarantee that the systems is dependable in face of error prone components at runtime?
        % assure that goals are always achieved, if they are achievable, in face of components faults ?
    }%
}\bigskip

This research question is the search to insert fault-tolerance.
