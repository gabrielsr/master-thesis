\section{Proposed Solution}

This work propose a method for a software centered system to self-configure itself at the level of deployment, driven by a goal model at runtime.
By our approach a device with computing capabilities is able to accept goals, evaluate its capabilities and context and find the software modules that enable it to achieve its goals, fetch and install them.
In response to changes the system can reevaluate its context, capabilities and available software modules and change its deployment.
