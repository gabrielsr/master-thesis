\section{Proposed Solution}

We propose a component model for goal oriented multi-agent systems  and a runtime model that allows reason about the system levels of operation.

This model will be implemented by a middleware, that will keep the traceability between goals and architecture and allow for managing the architecture.

In addition we pretend to implementing fault-tolerance techniques as reusable components.
