\section{Proposed Solution}

In order to allow reasoning about the system requirements, structure and context, we proposed a model that represents requirements as a Goal Model, the system structure in a component-based model and the context as a variable resolution mechanism.

This model will be implemented by a middleware, that will keep the traceability between goals and architecture and allow for manage the architecture and implement fault-tolerance mechanisms.
