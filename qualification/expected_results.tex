\section{Expected Results}

With this work we expect to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Collaborate to self-adaptation corpus of knowledge by contributing with a conceptual model that map concepts of Goal-Model and Architecture-based adaptation.

\item Generate a propose of architecture and reference middleware for development of applications that face a high level of uncertainty and couple with this uncertainty by reasoning about its goal model at runtime.

\item By, the former two item, we expect to allow for future development of more dynamic, yet dependable, software applications.

\end{itemize}
