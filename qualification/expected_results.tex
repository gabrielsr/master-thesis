\section{Expected Results}

With this work we expect to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Collaborate to self-adaptation corpus of knowledge by contributing with a conceptual model that maps concepts of Goal-Model and Architecture-based adaptation.

\item Generate a proposal of architecture and reference middleware for development of applications that face a high level of context variation and couple this uncertainty by reasoning about its goal model at runtime.

\item By the former two items, we expect to allow for future development of more flexible and dependable and adaptable software system.

\end{itemize}
