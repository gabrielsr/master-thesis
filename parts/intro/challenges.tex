\textbf{ Challenge 1: heterogeneous computing environment.}: the system is mean to run in a broad range of configurations of the computing environment.

\textbf{ Challenge 2: uncertainty at design time.} The system developer do not know the exact specification of the end user computing environment. This call for using abstract models of environment variability.

\textbf{ Challenge 3: dynamism.} Nodes and resources can enter and leave the environment. In response, the system should constant adapt to keep hight level goals achievable despite changes in the environment.

\textbf{ Challenge 4: openness.} Third party developers should be able to develop components to the system. The objective here is achieve decentralization and independence of provider. According, the system should not drive adaptation relying on models that can not be extensible at runtime.

\textbf{ Challenge 5: deployment specification accessible to users.} Users may change their goals in a given environment and lead to the need to deployment change. A system administrator with knowledge in software deployment could be not available.
