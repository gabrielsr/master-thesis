Imagine a smart-home scenario. A user wants a simple application to run in its home. The application has a single objective that is avoid interruptions if in work hours.
% TODO maybe not a good objective. this objetive lead to great deal of context change that affect other objectives and not different strategies of achieve an objective

What at first look can seems as a simple requirement can present difficult challenges. First of all is that the environment is possibly unknown by developers at design-time as different user can have different set of devices. And even a unique user can have a different combination of devices as the time goes by and the user update devices one by one. Also different devices can avoid interruption in different ways. The air-conditioner can avoid alert the user that the filters are dirty if its not in a critical level. The TV can avoid automatically turn on for a preprogrammed favorite TV show an rather record it on. The phone can be set to not ring and default to voice mail.

Goals

avoid interruptions
-synchronize user context
-disable not urgent interruption
-enable not urgent interruption
