\section{Self-Adaptive Systems}

Self-adaptivesses is an approach in which the system
\emph{"evaluates its own behavior and changes behavior when the evaluation indicates that it is not accomplishing what the software is intended to do, or when better functionality or performance is possible."}\cite{laddaga_self_1997}.
Self-adaptive systems (SAS) aims to adjust various artifacts or attributes in response to changes in the self and in the context of a software system\cite{salehie_self-adaptive_2009}.

A key concept in self-adaptive systems is the awareness of the system. It has two aspects\cite{salehie_self-adaptive_2009}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \emph{context-awareness} means that the system is aware of its context.
   \item \emph{self-awareness} means a system is aware of its own states and behaviors.
\end{itemize}

Schilit et al.\cite{klein_survey_2008} define \emph{context adaptation} as \say{a systemâ€™s capability of gathering information about the domain it shares an interface with, evaluating this information and changing its observable behavior according to the current situation}.

MAPE-K is a reference architecture originally proposed for autonomic computing~\cite{kephart_vision_2003} and that is often used as a model for architectures of SAS. It has a control loop, realized by a simple sequence of four activities: \emph{monitor}, \emph{analyze}, \emph{plan}, \emph{execute} and a \emph{knowledge} are. The adaptive system interacts with the environment or managed sub-system through \emph{sensors} and \emph{actuators}. The \emph{monitor} activity collects data from \emph{sensors}. That data
is \emph{analyzed}, and if a need of change is identified, a change request is dispatched, them an adaptation should be \emph{planned}. The resulting plan is passed to the \emph{execute} activity, which is performed through \emph{actuators}.

\subsection{Development of Self-Adaptive Systems}

For SAS some activities that traditionally occur at development-time are moved to runtime.  Andersson et al.~\cite{andersson_software_2013} proposed a process for development of adaptive systems.
In their approach, activities performed externally to the adaptive system are referred as \emph{off-line activities}, and activities performed internally in the adaptive system are \emph{on-line activities}. Off-line activities are mainly related to the design of the system, while online activities are related to the run-time of the system.

The left-hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:sas_lifecycle} represents a development life-cycle model. Off-line activities work on design model and source code in a product repository and produce the artifacts that will be used in the running system.
The right-hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:sas_lifecycle} depicts a running SAS. In this approach, we have \emph{Domain Logic} that is responsible for final user goals achievements. \emph{Adaptation Logic} is responsible for adapting the system in response to changes in the environment. In addition, the adaptation logic implements a control loop in line with the monitor-analyze-plan-execute (MAPE) loop~\cite{kephart_vision_2003}.
