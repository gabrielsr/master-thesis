        \textbf{Research Question 1 (RQ1):} Is it feasible and scalable to drive a system deployment using the system goal-model?
    }%
}\bigskip

Previous work in the literature \cite{pessoa_dependable_2015} have partially tackled this research question. However, our major concern here relates to the traceability between goals and tasks, software architectural components and the context of operation.

To develop what would be a good model we address further questions in relation to the fitness of the model for the purpose of deciding on system adaptations. First of all, we want to realize a valid deployment of the system:

    }%

        \textbf{Research Question 3 (RQ3):} Existing process could be adapted to the approach proposed in RQ2?
        % assure that goals are always achieved, if they are achievable, in face of components faults ?
    }%
}\bigskip

% Beside checking the system validity in other to predict system dependability, we want to be able to tolerate faults at runtime. This leads us to the next research question:

% This research question is the search to insert fault-tolerance.
