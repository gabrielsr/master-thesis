\section{Deployment Planning}
\label{sec:deployment_planning}

Planning for new goals.

A goal is deployable if all its context conditions and dependencies are satisfiable. If a goal is satisfiable there is a deployment plan that is able to satisfy this goal. A deployment plan consist of a set of artifacts that form a closure in the dependency graph and all nodes has context conditions satisfiable.
